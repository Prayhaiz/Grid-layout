To work with the Layout Grid 
1. First get your content on your html ready then start working on your stylesheet

Always have a container or a wrapper to wrap your elements as to be able to use css flexbox or grid

Set your container to either grid or flexbox depending on your project


Grid-template-dolumn is to set the width of each column in the project

Same goes to grid-template-rows, buh this can be in different sizes as the content differs
